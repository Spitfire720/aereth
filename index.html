<!-- LORE HOOK -->
<section class="section narrow">
<h2>The Shattering of Aereth</h2>
<p>
Aereth was once whole — a living world bound by continuity and meaning.
When the fracture occurred, reality did not collapse violently.
Instead, it <em>forgot itself</em>.
</p>
<p>
Cities exist half-remembered. Roads lead to absence.
The land persists through fragments of intent left behind by those who vanished.

<h2>The World of Aereth</h2>
<p>
From the Verdant Spiral of Elderwyth to the burning sanctums of Pyrexis,
Aereth is divided by regions that survived the fracture in different states.
</p>
<p>
Between them lies the Fractured Expanse — a scar of broken continuity where meaning decays.
